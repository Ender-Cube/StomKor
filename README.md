# StomKor

StomKor is a Parkour server written from scratch in [Minestom](https://minestom.net) to be configurable and performant

## Compilation

Run the below command to build the project then copy the file in `/build/libs/` to another folder.
```bash
./gradlew build
```

Then cd in to that folder and run
```bash
java -jar StomKor.jar
```
And that will generate the required files. Put a minecraft world in `./config/worlds/hub` then start the server again and join with Minecraft 1.19.2
